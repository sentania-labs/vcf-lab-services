# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

- Use [docs/validation.md](docs/validation.md) for the local validation commands
  that mirror CI, including the built-image and runnable appliance proofs.
- Treat [docs/redis-contract.md](docs/redis-contract.md) as authoritative for the
  boundary between the transient Redis bus and durable sync-state files.

## Maintaining this file

Keep this file for knowledge useful to almost every future agent session in this project.
Do not repeat what the codebase already shows; point to the authoritative file or command instead.
Prefer rewriting or pruning existing entries over appending new ones.
When updating this file, preserve this bar for all agents and keep entries concise.
